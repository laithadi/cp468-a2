first step: Check which cell has a value. 

second step: create the CSP for each empty cell (1-9) 

third step: go to every cell that has a value set in it from input. retrieve the row, column, and box its in. 

fourth step: create the constraint on those cells 

fifth step: to repeat the process for each value inputed from the text file 

sixth step: check which constraint gives us only one option 

7 step: if there is one option then play that option and update the rows columns and box contraints for that move
